# Type of crop and crop yield prediction using Machine learning

we have seen that among all the machine learning algorithms i have used, I found that Random Forest has the highest accuracy so i have saved the model as picked file and we will be reusing in our website for prediction


productivity model link is :https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EF-rtG0RL1O_Jaop8_B3SGiENc2wkIyh/view?usp=sharing



python version used:3.7

To run the Script:
Run the below commands in terminal
1.pip install -r requirements.txt
2.python run.py

use the local host link to access the page

for this model the test data is
phosphorous-128,nitrogen-24,potassium-196,ph-5.5,humidity-90,temperature-22,rainfall-110

output will be 0-since we have 49 labels apple is encoded as 0
